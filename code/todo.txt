*** print the % difference between the 50 and the 200. Color Code it.  Consider doing it on all timeframes like the candle meter

plot TDI divergence on price panel

*** move all plots in front of brinks, sessions, m candles


*** mark the london close in the future 12:30pm

fill the dead gap time + weekend time instead of NY/London sessions
it would be nice to have sidebar lines all in one place and separate from plotting

plot ADR Hi/Low

RDH/RDL
marker for end of week/month

move brinks to session levels
add brinks high/low to lines

list out alerts for all scripts


alert conditions for asia high/low

camarilla alert condition for level 4 breakout
some way to indicate that we are in high/low volume time
SV marker
pins marker
make the pvsra average input (10) tweakable


IDEA: Entry Condition Builder
- Toggle a list of conditions from settings
- For each active setting, draw a label - grey if condition is met, green if not
- use security to grab all conditions in one script
- 5 below 13, price below 50, price above pivot, etc.
- price above/below some adjustable value defined in settings (e.g. the psych high, or local low)
- alertcondition when all short conditions met
- alertcondition when all long conditions met





NON-CODE
- compile a bundle of entry signal screenshots based on the TDI. Use vertical line to mark entry/exit.  Use date/price range
- study how many candles is a valid retrace
- analyze best times of day

ALERTS
- think carefully about alert management.  Times of day that would be good to get alerts.
- alert when open interest shifts >= some percentage
- 15 MFI cross, 60 MFI cross, 240 MFI cross
- add an alert for MCB divergence on the 15 min
- on vector candle that has a body some percentage above the average body size
- on TDI divergence

/////////////////////////
// WEEKEND TASKS

// NOTES
///////////////////////////


GET LIQUIDITY POOLS
- get all past candles
- split into { coveredRanges: [{high, low}], uncoveredRanges: [{high, low}] }
- get all vector candles
- filter out any that are engulfed by any coveredRange
- trim any that overlap coveredRange
- merge vector candles together so that no vectors overlap each other - each range only covered once
- save to db
- method to add 1 candle which recalculates all
- 




Guaging a retrace back to the 50
- 13 support broken
- 5 cross 13 down
- retrace to 50

Trading the retrace to the 50 would be considered trading into the peak formation (and a no no)
