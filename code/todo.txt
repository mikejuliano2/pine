IDEA: Entry Condition Builder
- Toggle a list of conditions from settings
- For each active setting, draw a label - grey if condition is met, green if not
- use security to grab all conditions in one script
- 5 below 13, price below 50, price above pivot, etc.
- price above/below some adjustable value defined in settings (e.g. the psych high, or local low)
- alertcondition when all short conditions met
- alertcondition when all long conditions met


ALERTS
- think carefully about alert management.  Times of day that would be good to get alerts.
- alert when open interest shifts >= some percentage
- 15 MFI cross, 60 MFI cross, 240 MFI cross
- add an alert for MCB divergence on the 15 min
- on vector candle that has a body some percentage above the average body size
- on TDI divergence
